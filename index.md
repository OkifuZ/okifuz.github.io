I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in CS at [VR lab](https://vrlab.buaa.edu.cn/), Beihang University, advised by Prof. [Junjun Pan](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/junjun_pan), and anticipate graduation in 2025. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in CS from Beihang University in 2022.

My research interests lies in Computer Graphics, Physics Based Animation. Specifically, (a) fast collision handling (b) leveraging AI to accelerate physical animations. 
Besides, I'm passionate about game development, seeking to bridge the gap between physics based animations and video games.
