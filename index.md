I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Beihang University, advised by Prof. Junjun Pan, and anticipate graduation in 2025. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Beihang University in 2022.

My research interests lies in Computer Graphics, Physics Based Animation. Specifically, (a) collision handling for cloth, soft bodies and rigid bodies, (b) leveraging AI to accelerate physical simulations. 
Besides, I'm passionate about game development, seeking to bridge the gap between physics based animations and video games.
